# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
(My goals for this project are to take data from multple API's and use that data to create and visualize how the data from all sources relates to eachother and what things we can predict with the data we have.)

## Process
### ( The first step was to get the data on bike stations and points of interests around vancouver by using the API's given to us. after getting the API keys for YELP and FourSquare I then put the files into a database to use later on to create tables to use for later on in the project.)
### (After creating all  the databases I then looked at all of the data to see which tables had the informtaion that would help me the most. I then converted used SQL in python to select what I needed from the tables and then joined them together to make a new tbale with all of the information. after that I made a regression table and used it for making a bar chart to illustrate my data.)

## Results
(I used the data to see what type of bikes were getting rented out more. electric bikes or regular ones? I used a bar chart to show which type of bike had more available.)

## Challenges 
(the challenges I faced were mostly just getting the process down and not deciding what I wanted to graph or what was the best data for me to use. I found myself redoing steps over a lot when I was working on the project because I wanted to go back and grab more information from sources or having to go back and add more to my tables.)

## Future Goals
(If I had more time I would have made more tables or asked more questions I could have answered for myself as well as just making sure I was doing everything properly.)
